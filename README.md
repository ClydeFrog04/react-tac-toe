# React-Tac-Toe

## What is this project?
This project is a simple tic-tac-toe written in react. This is one of my early react projects and is a port of a javafx tic-tac-toe that I made early in my programming journey.
This project includes a computer player that has an easy or impossible difficulty. The impossible difficult implements a minimax method for finding the best move available.
With this minimax, it is impossible for the game to end in anything but a tie, or a win for the computer.
